# Agent Party Sprint Documentation

This directory contains the sprint planning and documentation for the Agent Party project. Each sprint follows our module-focused testing strategy and incremental progress principles.

## Sprint Structure

Each sprint is organized to:

1. **Focus on Module Completion**: Complete one module at a time with 100% test coverage before moving to the next
2. **Build Momentum**: Begin with smaller, simpler modules first
3. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure all code follows SOLID principles with comprehensive type annotations
4. **Document Progress**: Track coverage improvements and completed functionality

## Sprint Documents

- **sprint_X_plan.md**: Detailed plan for each sprint with tasks, tests, and coverage targets
- **sprint_workflow.md**: Standard workflow for implementing sprint tasks
- **sprint_review_X.md**: Review of completed sprints including lessons learned

## Test-Driven Development Approach

Our sprints implement a strict test-driven development approach:

1. Write tests first for each module functionality
2. Target 100% test coverage with strategic exclusions for impractical paths
3. Use proper mocking for dependencies
4. Run tests continuously during development

## Definition of Done

A sprint is considered complete when:

- All targeted modules have 100% test coverage
- All code follows SOLID principles with comprehensive type annotations
- All functions have proper docstrings with type information
- No commented-out or debug code remains
- No modernization conflicts remain
- Documentation is updated to reflect current implementation
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

## Current Sprint: Sprint 1

The current sprint focuses on achieving 100% test coverage for core utility modules:

- environment.py
- utils/__init__.py
- service_registry.py
- secret_manager.py
- config/settings.py
- __main__.py

Refer to [Sprint 1 Plan](sprint_1_plan.md) for detailed tasks and progress tracking.
