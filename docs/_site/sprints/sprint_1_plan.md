# Sprint 1: Foundation Modules & Modernization Implementation

## Sprint Overview

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Goal**: Achieve 100% test coverage for core utility modules while implementing key modernization objectives  
**Focus Areas**: Utility Modules, Configuration, Service Registry, Neo4j Integration  

## Strategic Approach

This sprint implements our module-focused testing strategy while advancing modernization goals:

1. **Incremental Progress**: Complete 100% test coverage for one module before moving to the next
2. **Build Momentum**: Begin with smaller, simpler modules first
3. **Quality First**: Ensure all code follows SOLID principles and includes comprehensive type annotations
4. **Modernization Implementation**: Apply consistent modernization patterns from our plan

## Modernization Goals for Sprint 1

1. **Type Annotation Modernization**
   - Convert all annotations to modern syntax (`dict`, `list`, `X | None`)
   - Add `Protocol` interfaces for service contracts
   - Use `Final` for constants
   - Add `TypedDict` for complex dictionaries

2. **Dependency Injection & Service Registry**
   - Consolidate service registry implementations
   - Implement consistent dependency injection pattern
   - Use Protocol interfaces for dependency contracts

3. **Error Handling & Validation**
   - Create standardized error hierarchies
   - Implement consistent error propagation patterns
   - Add Pydantic validation for configuration models

4. **Documentation & Code Quality**
   - Standardize docstring format across all modules
   - Add module-level docstrings explaining purpose
   - Apply consistent naming conventions
